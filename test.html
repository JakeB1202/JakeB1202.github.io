<h3>Put a Things here.</h1>
These rules must be followed at all times at all times. Players that choose not to follow these rules could receive anywhere from a 1 day temporary ban to a full permanent ban. To see a list of these rules in game, use <kbd>/rules</kbd>.

<p><strong>1.Respect everyone at all times</strong><br />MCFriends is a place for Minecraft players to come and feel comfortable. We expect all players to respect each other, especially staff. If a staff member (which includes Admin, Mods, Builders and MCFriends) asks you to do something, you do it.</p>

<p><strong>2. Keep the chat clean</strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No swearing.</strong></span> We have a custom built chat filter that blocks specific words, including variations of words. Trying to get around the chat filter will still warrant a mute if a staff member feels it is needed. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No spamming.</strong></span> Our chat filter also blocks duplicate messages. Adding a letter or symbol to send the same message over again will cause you to be muted. Spamming commands will also cause an automatic kick from the server. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No advertising.</strong></span> Although default players are not able to sent full URLs. Donors have the ability to post full URLs in chat, but will have the ability taken away if it is abused. Advertising includes other servers, YouTube/Twich channels, etc. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>USING ALL CAPS</strong></span> will result your chat being changed to lowercase. It Will Also Change Your Chat Like This And Send You A Warning Message.</p>

<p><strong>3. No client side modifications allowed</strong><br />While we do allow a small amount of mods, any mods that enhance your gameplay, gives you an unfair advantage or allows you to do something you normally wouldn't be able to are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not allowed</span>. If you have any questions about a mod you can ask an Administrator.</p>

<p><strong>4. No griefing, stealing or trolling</strong><br />Plan and simple, if it is not yours, leave it alone. As a player, you understand that trusting someone on your survival claim takes any reliability away from the server if your items get stolen.</p>

<p><strong>5. Keep the server looking good</strong><br />No not build inappropriate symbols or offensive builds. Staff reserve the right to remove any builds that they feel are inappropriate.</p>

<p><strong>6. Do not demand for server/plugin help</strong><br />We understand that a lot of players come to MCFriends because of Koz4Christ's YouTube channel. However, players shouldn't expect to join the server and get plugin help.</p>



<h3>Guidelines:</h3>
Although these are not explicit rules, we ask that every player on the server observes the following guidelines.

<p><strong>1. Account Responsibility</strong><br />Our staff bans accounts, not players. For that reason, if your account gets banned due to someone else using it, it is YOUR fault, not ours.</p>

<p><strong>2. Topics</strong><br />Don't jump into a conversation until you know exactly what is going on. If someone is talking about an official server topic, it's best to let a staff member handle it.</p>

<p><strong>3. Mini-modding</strong><br />We have a pretty awesome staff team, so please let them do their jobs. If someone is breaking the rules, it's better just to ignore them. They will eventually get bored and move on to another server. If for some reason they don't stop, you can always report them on the forum, which most admin have email notifications for.</p>

<p><strong>4. Conversations</strong><br />If you are going to have a lengthly conversations, we ask that you create a <kbd>/party</kbd> and use our <kbd>/party chat</kbd> feature.</p>

<p><strong>5. Grammar Enthusiasts</strong><br />The unique thing about being on the internet is that we have a vast number of players joining from all over the world. With that being said, spelling/grammar mistakes will happen, often leading to misunderstandings. Please don't correct players on their spelling/grammar.<p><strong>
